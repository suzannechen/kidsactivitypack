Kids Activity Pack curated for Create:Frontend 

### Kids Activity Pack Create:Frontend 
  
Let's face it. With the COVID-19 pandemic across the world, children, guardians, and parents are affected by the nationwide school closures. Many guardians and parents are struggling to work and manage kids at home at the same time.

Keeping children engaged is now essential as part of an Events Best Practice. At Microsoft, our DevRel team has introduced a Kids Activity Pack that will entertain children and provide a much-needed escape into the fun and magical worlds of imagination. All these happening while our developer parents and guardians attend our conference.

The Kids Activity pack debuts on the 29 Jul 2020 at the inaugural Microsoft Create: Frontend, a half-day virtual session where developers from the community come together to have conversations on pressing topics for frontend developers, such as building inclusive and accessible web applications, static sites, serverless, and much more.

No printer? We've got you covered digitally too. :)
As part of the event themed Static Web Applications, we have also created a digital version with static web apps https://lemon-forest-0f7a5171e.azurestaticapps.net/
